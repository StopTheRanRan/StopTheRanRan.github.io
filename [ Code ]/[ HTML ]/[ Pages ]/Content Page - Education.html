                                After entering the final year of my Bachelors I decided to continue my studies and specialise into science communication,
                                this passion originated in both my educational background with both presentational and video assignments in psychology,
                                as well as my experiences within writing science for the psychology newsletter and further afield experiences such as volunteering
                                within a museum gave me an appreciation for sharing and discussing knowledge with visitors.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout my masters, I was set assignments varying in the different fields of science communication and I
                                really challenged myself to explore as many areas of science within each of these as possible. I approached
                                feature articles discussing artificial intelligence and religion, explored mental illness alongside an OCD specialist
                                for a radio package, presented and narrated a documentary discovering how beavers are thriving on the River Avon and
                                helped developed a digital public initiative to get people talking about climate change (The bus stop science project).

                                I explored various mediums for science communication during my time on the course. Writing
                                science consisted not only of journalism features and articles, but opinion pieces and press
                                releases too. In terms of science media not only did we experience recording live radio at the
                                BBC Clifton Studios but also prerecording, interviewing for radio, and creating and editing radio
                                packages; as well as filming for documentaries, interviewing specialists on camera, and video editing.

                                This course also explored the theory behind science communication, including discussing audiences
                                and publics, legal issues within the industry, risk communication, diversity and cultural impacts
                                within science communication. Contemplating the places of scientists within public issues, cultural
                                historical objects within museums in different countries, and how to manage mis- and disinformation
                                in science communication.

                                This degree concluded with the formation of a dissertation, I approached this qualitatively surrounding
                                the topic of Certainty of Knowledge, a subcategory of personal epistemology running along a spectrum of
                                certainty to uncertainty, where certainty demonstrates a belief that knowledge is unchanging, and uncertainty
                                shows a belief that knowledge is liable to change. I utilised media analysis to investigate how science
                                communicators on YouTube were discussing scientific knowledge and found various techniques which demonstrated
                                both certainty and uncertainty.

                                Achieving a second class upper division in this course was the result of a deep exploration into the vast
                                disciplines within psychology, ranging from neurological and genetic ideas from biological and evolutionary
                                psychology, to ties with group dynamics and environmental influences in social and behavioural psychology.
                                Within my final year there are optional units and I decided to specialise with lesser known psychological
                                topics within gaming, sexuality and cyberpsychology.
                                <br><br>
                                During this course I not only wrote various academic essays, but completed various presentations
                                such as one discussing concepts surrounding Hebbian theory, created a video about the importance of
                                defining sex, and displayed a poster supplementing the dissertation I completed in my final year. The
                                project of which my dissertation pertains discussed the connection between characters in Roleplaying
                                Games, and the players that designed them to find consistencies particularly within the characters backstory.

                                in the first year as well as lab safety, the second year brought about specialisation into forensic science with
                                forensic variations of biology, chemistry, entomology, psychology and criminology to name a few.

                                Throughout the course we completed various experiments such as titrations, sterilisations and
                                growing bacterial cultures, as well as a crime scene simulation, in which we analysed blood
                                spatters, footprints, and various pieces of evidence such as clothing.

                                Secondary school was where I really developed my love of science, I resulted in an A for
                                each of the sciences, chemistry, biology, and physics. As well as an A and an A* for Methods in Mathematics,
                                and Applied Mathematics respectively. It was also where I developed many of my hobbies, such as my love for
                                poetry which I found through English class, with both English Language and English Literature resulting in a B.
