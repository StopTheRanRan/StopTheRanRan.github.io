                            Although my hometown doesnâ€™t have a science museum I felt very fortune to be able to volunteer at a local history museum.
                            I volunteered there for 3 months and learned a lot about how to talk to people without assuming a certain level of knowledge.
                            There were regularly a mix of people with widely different relationships to local history, from those who had never been to the area, to people who had lived there their whole life
                            As well as this, it was an experience where there were specific exhibits which I needed to learn about to assist visitors,
                            because of this I often found myself enjoying reading in detail about the history of the local railway even though I had never had any interest in this before.

                            Another opportunity where I was engaging with many different people was in the role of resident assistant, running events for university halls.
                            In this position I connected to a variety of students, mostly those pursuing postgraduate degrees.
                            It was fascinating to see the passions of so many different people and understand their interests.
                            As well as that I was able to give them spaces to pursue hobbies and relax in the face of stressful experiences.
                            I ran varying types of events ranging from arts and crafts such as acrylic pours, life drawing, and vision boards;
                            game nights such as parties with limbo and board games, to murder mysteries; as well as sports and excursions such as cycling around Bournemouth,
                            bus trips to the sea sauna and a colour run.
