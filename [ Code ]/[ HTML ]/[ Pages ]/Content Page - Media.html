                        An opportunity I was so lucky to be able to partake in was creating a documentary for my master's course
                        In this group project we planned and organised the topic, interviewees,
                        locations, scripting, equipment, filming and editing of the documentary by ourselves.
                        <br><br>
                        This hard work resulted in a short film surrounding beavers living on the River Avon,
                        we were so fortunate with the chance to interview a specialist who initially found
                        evidence of the beavers living in the area, as well as a specialist worker of the habitat who discussed
                        the suitability of the area.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        We even managed to organise canoeing down the river with one of the specialists,
                        and on this trip we located and recorded our own sighting of a beaver!

                        Another group project during my master's course was an "as-live" radio show recorded at the BBC studios in Bristol.
                        Together the group created the show's theme, collaborated on the script, and we all attended for the recording; to organise the scheduling and work the broadcasting desk.
                        <br><br>
                        We decided our theme to be about obsession and based our discussions throughout the show around this.
                        I took the lead on a prerecorded package and interviewed a psychologist regarding
                        OCD, editing the recording down to fit within the programme. I also helped organise and set up the live interview as this was via phone call.

                    <p>
                        Another project was to create a package to fit within a radio show of our choosing, and I was lucky
                        enough to interview another scientist regarding relationships between young people and digital gaming
                        cultures. I chose the topic, wrote the script alongside the interview questions, and edited the package all independently.
