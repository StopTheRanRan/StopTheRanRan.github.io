                        As part of my masters course, one of the assignments was to create a documentary,
                        as part of a group. Together we planned and organised the topic, interviewees,
                        locations, scripting, equipment, filming and editing of the documentary. We resulted in a short
                        film surrounding the beavers living on the River Avon, interviewing a specialist who found
                        the evidence they were initially there, and a specialist worker of the habitat who discussed
                        how suitable the environment is for them. Even managing to canoe down the river with the specialist
                        who helped us find and record the beavers living there.

                        Again during my masters course I took part in a group assignment, this one as a live radio piece
                        recorded in the BBC studios in Bristol. We formed the topic, script and were all in person there
                        during recording. We decided our theme to be about obsession and based our discussions throughout
                        the show around this. I took the lead on a prerecorded package and interviewed a psychologist regarding
                        OCD, editing the recording down to fit within the programme and helped add it to the scheduling for
                        the as-live show. I also helped organise and set up the as-live interview.
                        <br><br>
                        Another project was to create a package to fit within a radio show of our choosing, and I was lucky
                        enough to interview another scientist regarding relationships between young people and digital gaming
                        cultures. I chose the topic, wrote the script and interview questions, and edited the package all independently.
