                                Hi I’m Rianna and this is my portfolio. I recently completed my masters with the University of the West of England and now
                                I am looking to join the Science Communication industry to share my love of science to the community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After enjoying science since childhood, I followed some obscure educational routes, dipping my toes into forensics at college,
                                and eventually found myself deciding science communication was the route for me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My ties to psychology from my undergraduate degree at Bournemouth University really helped the way I view learning
                                and how to understand and talk to people, of which I achieved a Upper Second Class degree
                                and tying this with a media role in my postgraduate degree has given me a fuller view on how to pair audiences with genres and mediums.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I completed a placement as part of UWE’s learning lab, this was as part of the digital content team for We The Curious,
                                where I assisted with writing an article and joined to learn about their live events and the different members of staff around the science centre.
                                This was a great experience to understand how the industry works and how We The Curious have adapted when they were faced with both the pandemic and their fire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As well as this, I worked as a Resident Assistant during my final year of study of Psychology, which helped me understand how to run and organise events,
                                for example for creative sessions, tours around the town and coffee mornings.
                                I also helped out as a student editor for the Psychology Newsletter at Bournemouth,
                                talking to students about their experiences and successes in and outside of the university, greatly advancing my interviewing skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although my first love is science, I am someone who has interests in a wide variety of fields.
                                I love creative writing particularly poetry, music has always been something I enjoy within my spare time
                                and getting outside and active is greatly important to me.
                            </p>
