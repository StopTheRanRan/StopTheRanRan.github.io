                        Throughout my masters course I produced various articles in a journalistic style, particularly as part of the Science Writing unit.
                        Notably one which was published in Science Matters, a magazine created
                        by the University of the West of England. For this piece I interviewed a PhD student, writing an article
                        about their work regarding botanical gardens. This was the first project I worked on as part of the course and was a lovely
                        introduction into the field.

                        Since then, I have had a lot more experience particularly learning the structures of features and articles.
                        I utilised this knowledge when writing a piece for a fictional magazine surrounding Artificial Intelligence created as part of an assignment for the masters course,
                        in which I discuss the connection between Artificial Intelligence and religion.
                        This really challenged me to approach a sensitive topic with grace yet still discussing the science vigorously
                        and preparing a narrative alongside this. I really enjoyed writing this piece, one of my favourites still to date.

                        Another feature I wrote but was unfortunately never published was as part of my placement within We The Curious.
                        During my time there they were running a live show titled “Stories of the Soul”,
                        I wrote an accompanying article approaching the topic of why the soul is such a consistent topic across history
                        and how science cannot answer if a soul exists. This piece was really unique as I had to maintain a theme,
                        link to the live show but not take away from their content.

                        One area of science communication I was not expecting to fall in love with is opinion writing and reflective essays.
                        As I engaged with this form of writing more and more within my masters course, placing myself within stories just felt so honest to the pieces.
                        My experiences not only with the science I was writing about, but also with the writing and researching felt natural and something which fit into the stories.
                        I found myself often inspired by investigative writers such as Jon Ronson and this became a favourite style of writing of mine.

                        As part of the Science and Society unit in the masters course we were often set “reading relays”
                        and for one particular relay we were set to read a piece and discuss our experiences of reading and our thoughts and how they changed afterwards.
                        <br><br>
                        Here’s an excerpt:
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <div class = "quote">
                        <div class = "quote-background"></div>
                        <div class = "quote-text">

                                “Going into this reading, my mind wasn’t necessarily in a place to consider the implications that poor science communication can have on a community, over a span of decades.
                                It was a quiet, sunny afternoon in my flat a hundred miles from home, on the floor because my desk was packed for moving house,
                                and I just wanted to get this reading done. My boyfriend next to me, working on some programming I didn’t understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading is hard for me at the best of times on a computer, concentration is often fleeting and many times before,
                                I had given up, in a mess on the floor. But this time I was determined,
                                I put some music on and stared at the PDF on my laptop.
                                I reread the first sentence at least 4 times and was already unimpressed, it was about hill farming in Wales… I wondered why lecturers chose such weird papers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I slowly became more interested, before long I was distracting my partner with my excitable opinions on science communication
                                and how my life had been turned upside down from a book about farming.”

                        Another opinion piece we were set to write was as part of a portfolio project, this was focusing on any topic of our choice.
                        <br> <br>
                        After having recently completed the interview for my radio piece about OCD, this was still caught in my mind
                        and one specific topic I had asked him about yet didn't make the package was about the often misunderstood and potentially mythical “pure O OCD”.
                        It fascinated me because it is constantly argued about, but as all mental illness is to an extent defined by social constructs,
                        how important is it if it’s actually “real”? It felt quite natural to write about something I was so invested in and interested with at the time and made for an intriguing writing experience.

                                It’s been on my mind lately, and it got me wondering: If we’re still arguing about everything we’ve ever known, do we really know anything?
                                <br><br>
                                A couple of months ago for an unrelated project I spoke to a psychologist about obsessive compulsive disorder, more commonly referred to as “OCD”. In passing we discussed a subtype called Pure O, and we’ll come back to that later.

                                What fascinated me was their response…"

                        After I finished the writing science unit of my masters I felt really inspired to work on my own style of writing further,
                        so I started my blog. And while it’s not very consistent, even brainstorming ideas and thinking about the narratives I want
                        is allowing me to consider science in a deeper and more fulfilling way.
                        <br> <br>
                        My blog has differed in types of writing I include, from more traditional opinion pieces on science, to discussing life updates
                        such as progress with my dissertation, the experiences from my placement
                        and a deep dive on my masters course as a whole for those who may wish to partake in the future.

                        With one of my favourites pieces I have written being a silly post about the personality types of dogs!
